# Welcome! Benvenuti!
- 👋 Hi, I’m @alevanno
- 👀 I’m interested in data of all kinds, with a soft spot for geospatial applications
- 📍 I'm working in a map company (see the leitmotif?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the underlying infrastructures and services that enable data to be accessed and processed where it needs to
- 📫 I made a [nice website](https://alevanno.github.io/) where you can see some of my personal projects
